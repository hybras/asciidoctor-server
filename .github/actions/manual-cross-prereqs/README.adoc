= Cross compiling

This action sets up cross compilation support for ubuntu.
It installs the necessary packages.
It is NOT sufficient for full blown package development.
It only supports a handful of rust's most supported targets, with musl libc support thrown in for good measure.
It does not set environment variables either (CC, LD, include, etc), so you will need to do that yourself.
