= Asciidoctor Server

This is an attempt to have asciidoctor run as a server. This is useful for programs that use asciidoctor's cli, like static site generators (that aren't written in ruby). Spawning a ruby process for every file is https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/asciidoc-hugo-performance/10637/14[very wasteful] and squanders https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor/latest/features/#impressive-performance-and-strong-security[asciidoctor's speed].

== Implementation

The client is written in go to minimize startup overhead, though it could have been any compiled language.

The server is written in ruby.

The two communicate in grpc, with the client mapping its cli arguments to the asciidoctor api. Only a small subset of asciidoctor's arguments are supported
